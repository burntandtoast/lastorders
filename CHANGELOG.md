# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)
- Free `scan` packaged for `pip`/`pipx` (`modelmigrate` entry point; the name is a placeholder, see `scripts/rename_product.py`); no licence or API key needed.
- Provider-neutral **migration packs** (JSON + JSON Schema): OpenAI (full), Anthropic (stub). Fetched from a
  hosted URL at runtime with sha256 check, 24h cache and bundled offline fallback.
- Scanner, swap and report are generic engines driven by pack data (model IDs, aliases, families, shutdown dates,
  replacements, SDK/call-site signals, parameter/endpoint/tool-calling rules).
- GitHub Action (`action.yml`, composite): job summary, PR annotations, artifact upload, optional fail on high risk.
- Placeholder licence gate for `swap --apply`, `eval` and `report` (`MODELMIGRATE_LICENCE` / `--licence`). One licence = one GitHub repo (monorepos included).
- `init-evals`: generate a starter regression suite from the scan's call sites (prompts, schemas, tools read statically).
- Network policy: only the pack fetch (and, later, the licence check) contacts us; no telemetry. `--offline` / `MODELMIGRATE_OFFLINE=1`.
- `packs list|validate|build-site`; deployable static pack site for Vercel / Cloudflare Pages.

## 0.1.0
- Internal migration kit: scan, swap, eval (mock + live), client report.
